## About this dataset

* Original 2d images are comprised of 15 images extracted at the rate of 1 fps from a 14-second long video captured at 30 fps from an iPhone. 

* Sparse point clouds were generated by VisualSFM, Colmap and VisualMVG (sequential pipeline).

* Dense point cloud were generated using the sparse point cloud in the previous stage using either OpenMVS or PMVS2 & CMVS (integrated in VisualSFM)

* All .ply files could be converted to .off and other common point cloud formats.
