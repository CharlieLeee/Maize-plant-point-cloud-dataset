Naming guideline
=============

These folders contain dense point clouds were generated by **different** pipelines:

```
For example: colmap2openmvs
```
It means the `sparse point cloud` generated with `Colmap` is used to generate `dense point cloud` with `OpenMVS`

Whereas, there's a folder named: "_colmap_automatic_reconstruction_" in some dataset folder, that's because:

```
Colmap CUDA version offers a 'pictures --> dense point cloud' pipeline. However, it takes much more time than other methods (so this might not appear in other dense point cloud folders) 
```
